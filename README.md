## Project Documentation: Library Management System

**1. Project Overview:**

**Project Name:** Library Management System

**Project Description:** This project aims to develop a software application that helps manage library operations efficiently. The system will allow users to manage readers, books, and book issues.

**Objectives and Goals:**

- Provide a user-friendly interface for managing reader information, including adding, updating, and deleting reader records.
- Maintain a database of books, including title, author, genre, publication year, and available quantity.
- Track book issues, including issue date, due date, and returned status.
- Generate reports on reader activity, book availability, and overdue books.

**Key Features and Functionalities:**

- Manage reader information (add, update, delete)
- Manage book information (add, update, delete)
- Issue and return books
- Track book issue history
- Generate reports

**Target Audience and Stakeholders:**

- Librarians
- Library staff
- Readers

**Technologies and Frameworks Used:**

- Java
- Swing
- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
- Oracle Database

**2. System Architecture:**

**High-level Overview:**

The system consists of three main components:

- **User Interface:** Provides a graphical interface for users to interact with the system.
- **Business Logic:** Handles data validation, business rules, and database interactions.
- **Data Access Layer:** Connects to the database and performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

**Breakdown of Components and Modules:**

- **User Interface:**
  - Main window with buttons to access reader management, book management, and issue management
  - Individual windows for managing readers, books, and issues
- **Business Logic:**
  - Validates user input
  - Enforces business rules (e.g., book cannot be issued if not available)
  - Manages database connections
- **Data Access Layer:**
  - Connects to the Oracle database using JDBC
  - Executes SQL queries to perform CRUD operations on the database

**Data Flow and Interactions between Components:**

1. User interacts with the UI to add, update, or delete reader or book information.
2. UI sends data to the business logic layer.
3. Business logic validates data and enforces business rules.
4. Business logic interacts with the data access layer to perform database operations.
5. Data access layer executes SQL queries on the database and retrieves or updates data.
6. Results are returned to the business logic layer.
7. Business logic formats the results and sends them to the UI.
8. UI displays the results to the user.

**External Dependencies and Integrations:**

- Oracle Database (for data storage)

**3. Code Analysis:**

**Summary of the Code Structure and Organization:**

- The code is organized into separate classes for different functionalities.
- Classes are well-documented with comments.
- The code uses Java Swing for the user interface.
- JDBC is used to connect to the Oracle database.

**Analysis of Key Algorithms and Data Structures:**

- The code uses standard algorithms and data structures for tasks like managing collections and performing string manipulation.
- No complex algorithms or data structures are used.

**Review of Code Quality and Adherence to Best Practices:**

- The code is generally well-written and follows standard coding practices.
- Variable names are descriptive and consistent.
- Indentation and formatting are consistent.
- Error handling is implemented in key areas.

**Identification of Potential Issues and Areas for Improvement:**

- The code could be improved by using more efficient data structures and algorithms for specific tasks.
- The code could be further modularized to improve maintainability.
- Unit tests could be implemented to improve code coverage and ensure functionality.

## Installation and Deployment Instructions

**1. Prerequisites:**

- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 17 or later
- Oracle Database 18c or later
- JDBC driver for Oracle Database (e.g., ojdbc8.jar)

**2. Installation:**

1. Download the Library Management System application package.
2. Extract the downloaded package to a desired location.
3. Copy the JDBC driver file (ojdbc8.jar) to the application's lib directory.
4. (Optional) Configure database connection details in the application's configuration file (e.g., config.properties).

**3. Deployment:**

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the application directory.
2. Run the following command to start the application:

```
java -jar LibraryManagementSystem.jar
```

**4. Accessing the application:**

- The application will be accessible by default on port 8080.
- Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080

**5. Database Configuration:**

- The application uses an Oracle database for data storage.
- Ensure that the Oracle database is running and accessible.
- The configuration file (e.g., config.properties) provides options to set the database connection details:
  - `db.url`: URL of the database server
  - `db.username`: Database username
  - `db.password`: Database password

**6. Troubleshooting:**

- If the application fails to start, verify that the Java Runtime Environment is installed and that the JDBC driver is properly configured.
- Check the application log file for any error messages.
- Refer to the online help or contact the developer for further assistance.
